# Why
To create a wiki documentation with use-cases for users to understand and use the Python API.
There is a lot of data that is gathered when monitoring/researching and the purpose of this
Wiki, GitHub repo is to assist researchers with being able to access/manipulate the data while
having no programming/CS background

# Installation
What is needed is an application that can be used to run Python code

(For example: Download Anaconda Navigator to have access to Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab,
Google Collab can work as well)

Pandas and Geopandas are libraries inside of Jupyter Notebook/Lab that can be used to access,
read data

# Wiki

The Wiki has the different tools that can be used when accessing the data and what kind of data
is accessed. The Wiki has instructions as to how to get started. How to use the Python code
to get a selected date, or coordinates or data type. It also goes in depth with each feature
and explains the params, use and what should the output look like.
